## Known Issues:
   -  Label or label text should scale for larger strings
   -  Clicking or dragging a note or title should bring it to the front
   -  Resizing can cause existing notes to become unreachable
   -  Low Y width windows cause to UI to overlap onto itself
   -  Notes can display over top of UI forms and bottom elements

## Roadmap (in no particular order):
   -   [x] Allow customizing of note and label colors
   -   Get a proper favicon / Revise the "logo"
   -   Migrate build tool over to Vite
   -   Allow Editing of title, notes, and labels
   -   Allow for mini task lists inside of notes 
   -   Allow user to create multiple boards
   -   Allow user to add intelligent external links with auto formatting
   -   Alternate UI themes - additional presets at minimium, possibly user customizable
   -  Additional Note Types - Images, Videos, Audio, etc
